## Caution

**Alpha** version in CurseForge is generated in CI/CD in GiuHub. The function is not tested manually, so it may cause
unexpected crashes.

**Beta** version is generated by the author. I'll make sure it will successfully launch, and some machines work fine.

**Release** version is reserved for Forge version. Not for fabric version.

## Other works

### No plans

* Pump Plus
  * It is deleted. QuarryPlus already has its function.
* Workbench Plus
  * I'll make all items craft-able in crafting table.
* Mining Well Plus
  * I have never used this block.
* Solid Fuel Quarry
  * The cost of Quarry Plus is very cheap, so SFQ is not useful.
* EnchantMover, Book Mover
  * To enchant machines, use vanilla system.
* Spawner Controller
  * I think it's not related to quarry...

### Future works(plan)

* Chunk Destroyer
